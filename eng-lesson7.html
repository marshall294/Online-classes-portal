      <h3>Short Story: <em>The Lost Pencil</em></h3>
      <p>
        Nathan’s pencil was missing. He searched everywhere—his desk, his bag, even under the table. 
        Finally, he remembered lending it to his friend earlier that morning. 
        When he asked, his friend smiled and returned it, saying, “I was keeping it safe for you.” 
        Nathan laughed, learning that sometimes, what we think is lost is simply forgotten.
