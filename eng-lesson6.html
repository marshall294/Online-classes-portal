      <p class="italic text-gray-600 mb-3">Read carefully and think about what the story teaches.</p>

      <p>At Maple Grove Primary School, something strange was happening. Every day at noon, one lunchbox disappeared from the classroom shelf. 
      The students began to whisper and guess who might be taking it. Mrs. Luna, their teacher, decided to turn the problem into a mystery project.</p>

      <p>Each group of students wrote down clues and kept an eye on the lunch area. On Friday, Mia noticed crumbs near the window and small muddy paw prints on the floor. 
      The class waited quietly during lunch and soon saw a small brown puppy squeeze through the open window! Everyone laughed as the puppy wagged its tail and tried to lick the peanut-butter jar.</p>

      <p>Mrs. Luna explained that the puppy belonged to the gardener and had been exploring the classrooms looking for snacks. 
      The students helped clean the area and made a tiny doghouse for their new furry friend, whom they named “Scooter.” 
      From that day, no lunch ever went missing again.</p>
