  <!-- DEVELOPMENT OF THE ATOM -->
  <details open>
    <summary>1?? Development of the Atom</summary>
    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The atomic model evolved over time as scientists conducted experiments to better understand atomic structure.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>John Dalton (1800):</strong> Proposed atoms as indivisible solid spheres; each element has its own kind of atom.</li>
      <li><strong>J.J. Thomson (1897):</strong> Discovered the electron using cathode rays; proposed the “plum pudding model”.</li>
      <li><strong>Ernest Rutherford (1911):</strong> Gold foil experiment showed atoms have a small, dense, positive nucleus — most of the atom is empty space.</li>
      <li><strong>Niels Bohr (1913):</strong> Proposed electrons orbit in fixed energy levels (shells).</li>
      <li><strong>James Chadwick (1932):</strong> Discovered the neutron, explaining differences between atomic mass and atomic number.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example">
      <strong>Example:</strong> In Rutherford’s experiment, most a-particles passed through the gold foil (atom mostly empty), while some deflected — showing a dense nucleus.
    </div>
  </details>

  <!-- PROPERTIES OF RADIATION -->
  <details>
    <summary>2?? Properties of Radiation</summary>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Radioactive substances emit ionizing radiation from unstable nuclei. The three main types are alpha (a), beta (ß), and gamma (?).</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Type</th><th>Symbol</th><th>Charge</th><th>Mass</th><th>Penetration</th><th>Ionizing Power</th><th>Stopped By</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Alpha (a)</td><td>42He</td><td>+2</td><td>4</td><td>Low</td><td>High</td><td>Paper / Skin</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Beta (ß?)</td><td>°?1e</td><td>-1</td><td>Very Small</td><td>Medium</td><td>Moderate</td><td>Aluminium</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Gamma (?)</td><td>?</td><td>0</td><td>None (wave)</td><td>High</td><td>Low</td><td>Lead / Concrete</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p><strong>Ionization:</strong> Radiation knocks electrons off atoms, creating ions — this can damage living cells and DNA.</p>
    <div class="example">
      <strong>Example:</strong> Alpha radiation is highly ionizing but stopped by paper, while gamma radiation penetrates deeply and needs thick lead shielding.
    </div>
  </details>

  <!-- NUCLEAR EQUATIONS -->
  <details>
    <summary>3?? Nuclear Equations</summary>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Nuclear equations show how unstable nuclei change during decay. Both <strong>mass number (A)</strong> and <strong>atomic number (Z)</strong> are conserved.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Total mass number before = total mass number after.</li>
      <li>Total atomic number before = total atomic number after.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example">
      <strong>Alpha decay:</strong><br>
      ²³892U ? ²³490Th + 42He<br><br>
      <strong>Beta decay:</strong><br>
      ¹46C ? ¹47N + °?1e
    </div>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Gamma (?) radiation often follows alpha or beta decay when the nucleus releases extra energy.</p>
  </details>

  <!-- HALF-LIFE -->
  <details>
    <summary>4?? Half-Life Calculations</summary>
    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The <em>half-life</em> of a radioactive isotope is the time for half of its nuclei to decay.</p>
    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> N = N0(½)^(t/t½)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>N = remaining activity or nuclei</li>
      <li>N0 = initial activity</li>
      <li>t = time elapsed</li>
      <li>t½ = half-life</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example">
      <strong>Example:</strong> A sample has 800 Bq and a half-life of 10 s.<br>
      After 30 s: N = 800 × (½)³ = <strong>100 Bq</strong>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Applications:</strong> Carbon dating, medical tracers, and nuclear waste management.</p>
  </details>

  <!-- IRRADIATION & CONTAMINATION -->
  <details>
    <summary>5?? Irradiation and Contamination</summary>
    <p><strong>Irradiation:</strong> Exposure to radiation from an external source. Does not make objects radioactive.</p>
    <p><strong>Contamination:</strong> When radioactive materials land on or enter an object/person. The object becomes radioactive until decontaminated or decayed.</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Aspect</th><th>Irradiation</th><th>Contamination</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Cause</td><td>Exposure to radiation source</td><td>Contact with radioactive material</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Does it make object radioactive?</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Removable?</td><td>Yes (remove source)</td><td>Difficult (requires cleaning or decay)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Example</td><td>X-ray exposure</td><td>Spilled isotope on clothing</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p><strong>Safety Measures:</strong> Use shielding, increase distance, and minimize time (ALARA principle — “As Low As Reasonably Achievable”).</p>
